# Astreal

Astreal is a low overhead nodejs framework for building fast and secure APIs, using filesystem routing. While providing a type-safe developer experience.

### File system routing

The routes can be defined using file system routing. 
And will be compiled by the builtin cli tool, or via the rollup plugin, to provide a seemless developer experience.

### Type safety

The handler functions in the filesystem router have fully typed request and response objects, 
and route params can also optionally by typed and verified.
